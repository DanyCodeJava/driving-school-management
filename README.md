The project aims to develop a management system for a driving school to automate and streamline its administrative services, such as registering and managing students, instructors, and auxiliary staff, scheduling lessons, billing and fee management, and financial reporting.
The task of registering the student is handled by the administrative staff, and by logging into the application the student can see information about the progress of both classes and driving hours as well as scheduling exams. At registration students can choose between different training packages, based on which tuition fees are automatically calculated.
By logging into the app, the manager can track information about the number of students enrolled, the number of instructors, and financial information. The manager's dashboard contains two charts that show information about the number of students enrolled per month and revenue per month as well.
The application can also generate printable enrollee's details and printable date-wise payment reports.
